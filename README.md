This is my flakes for literally everything (that i have and i can think of)

You can fork or clone to use it for yourself but remember to rename the username and hostname

you can install by using this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/RafaelC-67/Flakes.git ~/.local/share/Flakes
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flakes ~/.local/share/Flakes
```

after that you can rebuild the system with:
```
switch
```
